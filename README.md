- 👋 Hi, my name is Ashin!
- ✨ I currently work as a Technical Artist at DNEG London
     (well my official title reads Technical Lighting TD - which when expanded is Technical Lighting Technical Direcor.
     Yes, it's so technical that you have to say it twice! ;) )
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can about becoming a better developer, thanks to all the amazing open source contributions made here.
- 💞️ I mostly work in Katana, Houdini and Renderman, but I love everything about computer graphics. I would love to give back to the community by developing
      open source plugins and tools and also share a few tips and tricks that I picked up over the last 10 years :)
